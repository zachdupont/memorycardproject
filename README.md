# Memory Card Project
Full image backups of various memory cards for 5th & 6th generation video game consoles to serve as a time capsule of the pre-HD era in gaming.

None of these saves are personally mine, and the memory cards are typically sourced from untested lots on sites like eBay.

All memory cards are unencrypted and available to use in an emulator of your choice.

This is not a repository for unlocked or 100% saves.

https://github.com/ShendoXT/memcardrex - For exporting real PS1 memory cards using adapters such as the DexDrive, PS3 Memory Card Adapter, and various other methods. PS1 saves are unencrypted by default and thus it's much simpler to back these up on a PC without spinning up a container as I see myself doing with PS2 memory cards.

https://hub.docker.com/r/islandc/ps3mca - Container image for reading and exporting real PS2 memory cards using the PS3 Memory Card Adapter, without needing a PS2/PS3. Although I can't confirm it's functionality with third-party adapters, it works great with my OEM Sony adapter for the PS3.
