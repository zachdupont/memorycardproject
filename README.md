# Save Game Project
General time capsule of various savegames up to typically the 6th generation of video game consoles. Game saves are archived in a non-encrypted state and can be used in emulators such as Dolphin, Duckstation or PCSX2. The goal of this project is to archive as many cartridge and memory card-based game saves as I can get my hands on, usually backed up from the physical carts themselves, as a way of preserving a small part of gaming history before the HD era. 

This is not a repository for unlocked or 100% saves.
