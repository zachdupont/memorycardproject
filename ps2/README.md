# NOTE
Some of these memory cards had PS1 saves in them if you're looking for some PS1 saves, however make sure you copy these individual saves to a PS1 memory card (for those playing on real hardware) or a PS1 memory card container format such as .mcr using PCSX2 or another tool if you plan on playing with these saves as PS1 games cannot read from PS2 memory cards.
